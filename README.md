This is a repository to store my DE Learning Path &amp; Materials

1. Docker  
Links:  
1.1 https://github.com/docker/labs/tree/master/beginner - This repo guide through the basics of docker and explain the code row by row so it's very easy to follow. It helps to understand how docker work and the basics steps that need to take place in order to run an application from Docker.  
1.2 https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/ - This tutorial guide through the basics of docker-compose and explain the code row by row so it's very easy to follow. It helps to understand how docker-compose work together with dockerfile and the basics steps & commands to use docker-compose for application development. The use case here is that we can update the application without having to re-build it. I recommend to go through Environment variables, Environment file, and Networking to understand how they work  and how to set up in compose.
